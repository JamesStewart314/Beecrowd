# BeeCrowd

  ***My simple solutions to programming challenges on the BeeCrowd platform (formerly known as URI) will be stored here in this repository.***

 All solutions were created based on the Python programming language. As these were my first contacts with programming problems, all codes were written using very amateur logic and syntax, so I ask you to disregard this aspect.
I will archive these codes solely for the purpose of documenting my progress in learning this language.
